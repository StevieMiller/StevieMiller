## Jr. Digital Media Engineer

My current job position requires me to create graphics for and help maintain the websites for the Carlsbad Municipal School District. I have always been interested in web development, specifically UX, UI, and graphic design, and I currently have the opportunity to attend Rice University's Coding Bootcamp online. 

I expect to graduate with a certification in May 2023.
